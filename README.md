# Task-manager
This is a web-application to help manage various tasks.
To organize the workspace for your tasks, we created a multi-function board with cards, which are distributed to different columns depending on the implementation phase: backlog, in progress, review or done.
Here in this app users have accesss to a wide range of different features: 

<li>creating task cards</li>
<li>filling in the description and editting the text of a task</li>
<li>changing the position of a task card on the list</li>
<li>moving a task card through the lists (using Drag N Drop)</li>
<li>deleting a task card or all the fullfilled ones</li>
<li>assigning a user a task card</li>
<li>setting a priority for completion in each card</li>

Besides there is a convenient filter filtering the cards by various parameters, as well as a task search.
For the convenience of the user, there's an apportunity to change the color theme(from dark to light).
